    "V(x,y,z)=-\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $e$ is the charge of the electron.\n",
    "So the Schrödinger equation $(1)$ for the electron in the Hydrogen atom is:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Now, the most convenient way to proceed is to solve the equation for those $\\Psi$ which are energy eigenfunctions, (or eigenvectors of the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian), since from them, taking advantage of the linearity of the Schrödinger Equation, we can represent through the superposition principle any state $\\Psi$. \n",
    "Solving the Schrödinger Equation, it turns out that, if $\\psi(x,y,z)$ is an energy eigenstate, and\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The best way to approach (5) is to use the method of separation of the variables. The only problem we have is that $V(x)$ is a function of $x, y$ and $z$ together, so it won't be easy to express as a product of functions. What we can do is to change our variables from cartesian to spherical, and, with reference to the following reference frame, we will have:\n",

    "Done! We have found the wavefunctions (44a/b) as a function of the three spherical coordinates for the electron in the hydrogen atom. <br>By themselves, these wavefunctions have no meaning. However, if we take the modulus squared of it, we obtain the probability density over the space as a function of $r,\\theta,\\phi$ for the electron in the Hydrogen (and Hydrogen-like) atom. (Since we are interested in the modulus squared of the wavefunction, (44b) doesn't add anything to our physical analysis, since its modulus squared is equal to the modulus squared of (44a), so from now on we will be referring to (44a) since it is simpler).<br>It is impossible to visualize $\\psi_{n,l,m_l}(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ as given in (44a), and so it is to visualize its modulus squared.<br>\n",
    "To help understanding what (44a) is telling us, we can write a computer program which graphs for us the probability distributions for finding the electron at a given point over the space. <br>\n",
    "We will do it here using Python, Matplotlib and Numpy.<br>\n",
    "The code will have to do the following:<br><br>\n",
    "    1)Ask us for the particular state (or equivalently for the $n,l,m_l$ parameters for $\\psi_{n,l,m_l}(r,\\theta,\\phi)$      corresponding to the state we are interested in) we wish to visualize<br>\n",
    "    2)Show the 3D plot of the function corresponding to the $\\psi$ we have requested to visualize (we will express $\\psi$ in cartesian coordinates in the code since it will be easier to plot with matplotlib)<br><br>\n",
    "We want to have a 3D scatter plot made up of a large number of points and in which an high density of points in a region of space means an high probability of finding the electron in such a region of space when performing a measurement.<br>\n",
    "It can be done with a so-called Monte Carlo method. Actually, the name comprhends lots of algorythms and methods used in computer simulation roughly speaking based on the association between random number distributions and numeric values. <br>To understand what we are going to do, let's do a simpler example:<br>\n",
    "Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ which is the modulus squared of a one dimensional wavefunction associated with a particle: $f(x): P(x)=e^{-x^2}$ (in this case I have choosen a Gaussian since it is nice to work with)\n",
    "where $P(x)$ is a probablity dinstribution over $x$ and we want to represent it with a scatter graph such that where the points are more clustered toghether is where the probability of finding the particle is higher. <br>The problem is: how we create such a relation between the density of the distribution of the points in space and the probability distribution given above?<br>\n",
    "It is not so difficult if you think about it: first of all, you pick an infitisimal interval $dx$ over which $f(x)$ is defined.<br> Than you can generate a random number and compare it with the value of $f(x)$ in the interval $dx$. If the random number is less or equal to $f(x)$, then you plot it in the scatter graph giving it a coordinate corresponding to the x coordinate of the interval dx you are acting on. If the random number is higher than $f(x)$, then you simply discard it. <br>Then you go on doing this process for differents $dx$ and differents random numbers.<br> Visually, we could plot the random number giving it a y coordinate corresponding to its value on a graph of the gaussian. <br>Then, we take all the random points that are below the graph of the gaussian and plot them in the scatter graph, discarding all the others. <br>At the end, there will be more points towards the y axis than at the extremes of the gaussian, due to the shape of the gaussian graph, which is higher in the middle.<br> Therefore, when we will scatter graph the points below the gaussian, most of them will be clustered at one point corresponding to the y axis (or x=0 line) in the graph of the gaussian, meaning that there the probablity of finding the particle is higher than anywhere else (this is of course coherent with the result we would get observing the probability distribution function represented by the gaussian).<br> So we have build a correspondence between the graph of the function and the density of the distribution of points in space. Since the graph of a function has a deep relation with the function itself, we have achieved our goal to get a relation between the values of a function and the distribution of points graphed in space.<br>\n",
    "We can apply this reasoning to our more complex situation with just some little modifications:\n",
    "first of all, we have a probablity distribution over the whole 3D space, and not only over the $x$ axis. It is not a big deal, since we could plot a graph with the function vs the \"space\" (where with \"space\" I mean the set of all the possibles points in the 3D space) and do the same reasoning as before, with the only difference that in our case instead of the $x$ axis we have a \"space\" axis representing all the points in the 3D space. (If it is not clear just think about it or go on reading, maybe it will became clear to you as you think of it).<br>\n",
    "The only thing is that we will have to calculate the function giving it three arguments (x,y,z) but this isn't a big deal neither, as we will see.<br>\n",
    "So, let's get started. <br>First of all, let's import the following libraries in our code:"

    "\n",
    "Now, let's summarize our long journey and make a few considerations, starting from the very beginning.<br>\n",
    "What we wanted to do is find the solution to the Schrödinger Equation (1) for the electron in the system represented by the Hydrogen atom, or equivalently to find a wavefunctions that accurately and completely describes the physical state for the electron.<br>\n",
    "In particular, we choosed to find those particular wavefunctions satysfing (4).<br>\n",
    "These functions are the so called energy eigenstates, and they are really interesting for many reasons. Some of them are the following: firstly, they are stationary states, this meaning that over the time they don't change except for an overall phase factor, which is meaningless in the physical aspect of the problem, as we saw. <br>\n",
    "In addition to that, solving for the Energy eigenvalues will allow us to obtain a solution to (1) for every non-eigenfunction, since every function is expressable through superposition of eigenfunction.<br>\n",
    "Considering the fact that in the atom the electron is in a Coulomb potential described by (2), we could write the hamiltonian for the system and be ready to solve (5).<br>\n",
    "This is a rather complex partial differential equation, and to simplify things in order to solve it by the variable separation method, we have choosen to switch to spherical coordinates.<br>\n",
    "Doing calculations, we ended up with three equation: one for the azimuth (or $\\Phi$) part, one for the radial (or $R$) part and one for the polar part (or $\\Theta$). <br>\n",
    "We solved the $\\Phi$ part firstly and, in addition to come up with a solution for it, we discovered that this solution is tied to an integer, namely $m_l$. <br>\n",
    "We then solved the $\\Theta$ equation, and, in this case too, not only we found an expression for $\\Theta$, but we discovered that this solution is tied with another non negative integer, $l$, and, again, to $m_l$. Moreover, we found that $-l\\leq m_l \\leq l$.\n",
    "Finally we solved the $R$ part, and even in this case we found another integer, $n$ which is related to the $R$ part solution. We found also that $l$ can't be greater than $n-1$. <br>\n",
    "From the solution to the radial equation, we found something rather remarkable: in (43) we discovered that the allowed energies that the electron in the Hydrogen atom can hava form a discrete spectrum. <br>\n",
    "The energies for the electron is quantized, they can be only some particular values depending on the integer $n$.<br>\n",
    "Tha value of the energy of the elctron in an Hydrogen atom can't be whatever number. The electron can't have an energy between the ones corresponding (for example) to $n$ and $n+1$.<br>\n",
    "This is a truly important result. <br>\n",
    "In fact, among all the consequences this result has, there is the true explanation of the light emission spectra, and the development of the theory of spectrometry, which has an huge amount of practical application.<br>\n",
    "Onother thing to notice is that the energies for all the allowed states for the electron are negative. This means that the electron in the Hydrogen atom has less energy than it has when it is free and unbound. It means that it takes energy to pull out the electron from the Hydrogen atom. <br>\n",
    "More precisely, if the electron is in a state corresponding to the lowest possible value of $E$, it takes $13.6 eV$ to pull the electron out, (or more technically to ionize it).<br> It is interesting to notice that the result in (43) is the same of the one achieved experimentally by Rydberg and theorically by Bhor, who however started from different assumptions and hypothesis on the nature of the atom and of the motion of the electron around the nucleous. <br>\n",
    "Coming back to our derivation, once we got the three expressions for $R(r),\\Phi(\\phi),\\Theta(\\theta)$ we multiplied together all these three expressions and ended up with the solution $\\psi$ representing the wavefunction describing the state of the electron. <br>Its modulus squared represent the probability density over the 3D space of finding the electron in a given point when performing a measurement on it. <br>This probability density doesn't change as the time goes on, and it is because, as we said, $\\psi$ is an energy eigenstate. <br>However, the electron could be in a superposition of two or more energy eigenstates.<br> In this case, there will be an interference term which will prvent the state to be stationary in time. <br>Having said that, we written a code that, using a Monte Carlo method, graphs for us the probability density distribution over the space. <br>The region of space where there is a big cluster of points is the one where the electron is most likely to be found. <br>These weird shapes the so called orbitals. <br>It is important to stress the fact (although at this point it should be clear) that the model Bhor proposed for the atom is wrong. <br>The electron doesn't move on any type of orbit around the nucleous, as Bhor supposed. <br>If it were so, the electron would radiate its energy in a fraction of a second, end the atom will collapse. <br>Instead, the wavefunction that describes the electron is a superposition of position eigenfunctions, in which the electron wavefunction instantaneusly collapses when we performe a measure with a predictable probability (This is what it is called quantum dechoerence), but nothing tell us that the electron was there before. The only thing we can know is how the wavefunction evolves, not the position of the electron.<br>\n",
    "The last thing to say, although there would be a tremendous amount of things to say, is that $n,l,m_l$ are what we call the quantum numbers. $n$ is associated, as we saw, to the energy of the electron, and it is called the principal quantum number. Instead, it can be shown that $l$ determines the angular momentum of the electron and it is called the angular momentum quantum number. $m_l$, which is called the magnetic quantum number, determines the orientation of the orbitals in space, and determines the z-component of the angular momentum.<br> However, it is not in the purposes of these article the analysis of what the quantum numbers determine precisely, so I won't go through that.<br><br>\n",
    "All of this is a very noteworth result of quantum mechanics, showing its power in some real life application, not only in infinite square well and similar problems, and remembering us that nature doesn't reflect our intuition and expectations as many of us still believe. In fact, if you think about it, there is not so much Physics in this derivation. Indeed, it turns out that it is often the mathematical model developed under physical assumptions, alongisde with all the mathematical tools behind it, to lead to new discoveries and results where our intuitin fails, as in in this case. No way would it be possible to achieve such a result, nor to develope the theory of Quantum Mechanics, so far the best theory for describing our world, staring at nature with naked eyes and making hypothesis based on intuition or logic. The nature doesn't have to make sense to us, and we should accept it. <br>\n",
